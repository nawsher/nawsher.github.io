title: Crossroads!
---

When you are at a major crossroad in your career, sometimes the best thing you can do is sleep on it. My wife and I have decided to move to Australia with the kids, and begin a new chapter in our life. As a head start, I intend to travel to Sydney and Melbourne next month for around six weeks. You know, get a fresh perspective of the economy and industry itself. And perhaps take it from there - let's see how it spans out.
